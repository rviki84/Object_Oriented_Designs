# OOD_Example
Demonstrates SOLID principles in Object Oriented Design (OOD) using shapes and area/volume sum calculator classes

# Calculator
The *Calculator.cs* demonstrates **Single Responsibility, Open-Closed and Liskov Substitution** principles from SOLID using the *Area/Volume Sum Calculator* and *SumOutputFormatter* classes

# Shapes
The *Shapes.cs* contains different (2D and 3D) shapes classes implementing different interfaces to demonstrate the **Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion** principles from SOLID
